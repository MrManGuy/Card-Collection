Only need to run every new set (or update the files manually)
1. Run tcg_to_api.py
    This file asks for what tcg set correlates to what api set, outputs to pokemon_tcg_ids.json
2. Run sets_to_json.py
    This file pulls all cards from all sets and creates a corresponding json file

Run everytime inventory is updated
3. Run inventory_csv_fixing.py
    This file creates a new file called pokemon_fixed_cards.csv where the set as listed on the api and any number in the name is the number in the set
4. Run set_totaling.py
    This file goes over the cards in pokemon_fixed_cards.csv and adds the counts to the corresponding Sets/set
