# Project Notes

Simple project to track and view which Pokemon cards are owned. 
This is not designed for other's to use, mostly due to tcgplayer not having an API to my knowledge.
However, that doesn't mean I wouldn't change the project if remaking it, I would probably do the following if I remade it:

- Use React or some other web framework. Since learning React, the way I build websites has changed
- Better logic for pulling sets. I had a manual system that required me to pull ALL the sets whenever a new set was added, nightmare.
